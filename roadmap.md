# PhasmaPay — Roadmap

PhasmaPay's roadmap is a progression from address isolation to full payment privacy to invisible crypto rails.

**Phase 1 — Now.** NFC tap-to-pay USDC with ghost mode (ephemeral addresses per payment), SKR tiered cashback, Jupiter auto-swap, and phone-to-phone HCE. Privacy level: address isolation — the merchant's real wallet never appears on-chain.

**Phase 2 — Shielded.** Light Protocol integration for fully private transfers. Privacy level: amounts and recipients hidden on-chain, not just addresses.

**Phase 3 — Fiat Rails.** On-ramp to USDC, off-ramp from USDC. Neither side touches crypto directly. Privacy level: full privacy plus fiat convenience.

**Phase 4 — Multi-token.** Accept any SPL token, auto-swap to merchant's preferred settlement currency. Privacy level: token-agnostic private payments.

## Vision

Ghost addresses are step one. The end state: crypto rails invisible to both sides. Payer pays with fiat, merchant receives fiat. Solana settles in the background. Neither side knows or cares about blockchain. The merchant's financial privacy is protected by default.
